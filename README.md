# To-Do-Application
# A simple to do with basic task adding and completion double-clicks features
It's one of my old python projects that was to create a simple to-do application that can add and remove tasks from to-do window to completed window.
The graphics of this application is basic and is created using the tkinter library in python.
Enjoy adding features to this project if you like
